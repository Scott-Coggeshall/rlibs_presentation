#  `r emo::ji('books')` Libraries `r emo::ji('books')`

--

An `R` library is a folder that

--

 -contains installed versions of `R` packages
 
--
 
 -is on the library search path set by `.libPaths`

--

What is/isn't a library is session dependent

--

We can have multiple libraries in a given session


---
#  `r emo::ji('books')` Libraries `r emo::ji('books')`
--

The `.libPaths` function is used to show which folders are currently on the library search path...
```{r}

.libPaths(new = )

```

--

...and to add new folders to the search path

```{r}

.libPaths(c("D:/SCOTT/library2", .libPaths()))

.libPaths()

```

--

When you run `library("package_name")`, `R` looks in the folders listed in `.libPaths()` in that order for the package `package_name` 

--

When you run `install.packages("package_name")`, `R` will try to install the package to the FIRST folder listed in `.libPaths()`

# `r emo::ji('woman_technologist')` User Profiles `r emo::ji('man_technologist')`



--

Plain text file called `".Rprofile"`

--

 Note: name has to be exact. `r emo::ji("cross_mark")` NO FILE EXTENSIONS (E.G. ".TXT") ALLOWED! `r emo::ji("cross_mark")`

--

Contains `R` code that is (invisibly) sourced into your `R` session on start-up

--

The easiest way to create and maintain your own personal `R` library is to add 

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
.libPaths("path-to-my-library")
```

to your `.Rprofile`. 

--

# `r emo::ji('magnifying_glass_tilted_right')` How does `R` know where to find your `.Rprofile`? `r emo::ji('magnifying_glass_tilted_left')`

# `r emo::ji('globe_showing_Americas')` Environment Variables `r emo::ji('globe_showing_Americas')`

--

Variables defined at the `operating system` level 

--

Affect how programs behave

--

From within `R`, can check environment variables with `Sys.getenv()`

```{r}

Sys.getenv("HOME")

```

--

Can also (temporarily) set environment variables with `Sys.setenv()`

```{r}

Sys.setenv(MY_AUTH_TOKEN = "dasofj3r24ijijsdfjasiji24j2ij4ijijwisasd")

Sys.getenv("MY_AUTH_TOKEN")
```

---
# `r emo::ji('globe_showing_Americas')` Environment Variables `r emo::ji('globe_showing_Americas')`

--

On startup, `R` looks for a number of environment variables to configure the session

--

Details at `help(Startup)`

--

To find the `.Rprofile`, `R` looks in the following places (in this order)

--

1. the file path in an environment variable called `R_PROFILE_USER`

--

2. the current directory

--

3. the user's home directory (see what yours is using `Sys.getenv("HOME")`)

# Wrapping up

--

You can make just about any folder be an `R` library

--

-For your personal library, make sure you have read/write permissions

--

-Best to have a folder exclusively dedicated to housing `R` packages

--

Automatically point `R` to your personal library on start-up using an `.Rprofile`

--

Use `R_PROFILE_USER` to tell `R` where to look for your `.Rprofile`
